<!-- .gitignore will prevent untracked files from being added (without an add -f) to the set of files tracked by Git, however Git will continue to track any files that are already being tracked.

To stop tracking a file you need to remove it from the index. This can be achieved with this command.

git rm --cached <file>
If you want to remove a whole folder, you need to remove all files in it recursively.

git rm -r --cached <folder> -->

<!--  -->
<!-- $ flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main  -->
<!-- $ dart  pub global run rename --appname "Lent" -->
